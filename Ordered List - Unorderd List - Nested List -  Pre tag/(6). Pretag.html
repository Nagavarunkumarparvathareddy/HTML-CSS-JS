    <pre><h1>Linked List : Introduction</h1>
        
        Imagine you are given a task where you have to maintain a data entry of cars entering a parking lot. 

        Since the number of cars entering will be different and may change daily, constructing a <b>fixed-sized data structure</b>
        like an array might not be helpful. 

        This is when <b>linked lists</b> come into the picture,which allows us to add and remove cars easily. 

        Unlike arrays, <b>linked lists</b> have a <b>variable size</b> and can be <b>modified to our needs.</b>

        <h3>What is a Linked List?</h3>
        
        It is a linear data structure that can be visualized as a <b>chain</b> with different <b>nodes connected</b>, where each <b>node</b> represents a different element.
        The difference between arrays and linked lists is that, unlike arrays, the elements are not stored at a contiguous location.
        
        Since for any element to be added in an array, we need the exact next memory location to be empty, and it is impossible to guarantee that it is possible. 
        Hence adding elements to an array is not possible after the initial assignment of size.
        
        A linked list is a data structure containing two crucial pieces of information, the first being the <b>data</b> and the other being <b>the pointer to the next element.
        </b>  The ‘head’ is the <b>first node</b>, and the <b>‘tail’</b> is the <b>last node</b> in a linked list.

        <h3>Creating a Linked List</h3>
        
        There are two information sets to store at every node, thus there is a need to create a self-defined data type to handle them. 

        Therefore, we will use the help of <b>structs</b> and <b>classes</b>.

        To learn about <a href="https://takeuforward.org/structure/classes-and-structures-in-c/" target="_blank">structs and classes</a>, you can refer to this article.
        
        To understand linked lists better, let’s take the help of an example:
        
        <h3>Code:</h3><h4>Python</h4> 
        
        class Node {
            constructor(data1, next1 = null) {
                this.data = data1;
                this.next = next1;
            }
        }
        // Creating a new Node with the value from the array
        let y = new Node(2);
        // Printing the data stored in the Node
        console.log(y.data);
        
        <h3>Output: 2</h3>

        [tabby title="JavaScript Code"]

        class Node {
            constructor(data1, next1 = null) {
                this.data = data1;
                this.next = next1;
            }
        }
        // Creating a new Node with the value from the array
        let y = new Node(2);
        // Printing the data stored in the Node
        console.log(y.data);

        <h3>Output: 2</h3>
        
        Let's break this example to understand how it works:
        
        <ul>
            <li>The struct has two data types: <b>data</b> which contains the value of the node and a <b>pointer next</b>, which points to the next node in the list.</li>
            <li>There is a <b>constructor</b> which assigns the values to a new node.</li>
            <li>A <b>new</b> keyword is used to dynamically allocate memory to a node with data as arr[0].</li>
        </ul>

        The combination of the given parameters and functions initializes a linked list.

        <h3>Understanding Pointers</h3>
        
        A <b>pointer</b> is a variable that <b>stores the memory address</b> of another variable. In simpler terms, it <b>"points"</b>  to the <b>location in memory</b> where data is stored. 
        This allows you to indirectly access and manipulate data by referring to its <b>memory address.</b>
        
        <b>Code:</b>
        class Node {
            constructor(data1, next1 = null) {
                this.data = data1;
                this.next = next1;
            }
        }
        // Creating a Node 'x' with the first element of the array
        let x = new Node(2);
        // Creating a reference 'y' pointing to the same Node 'x'
        let y = x;
        // Printing the reference 'y', which represents the memory address of the Node 'x'
        console.log(y);
        
        <b>Output: 1dbd16a6</b>

        Java does not explicitly use pointers or take the address of variables as you do in C++. Instead, we have reference variables. 
        These <b>reference variables</b> do not directly contain memory addresses like pointers in languages such as C or C++. 
        Instead, they <b>hold references</b> to <b>objects in memory.</b>
        
        <b>Understanding the difference between Node and Node*:</b>
        A <b>node</b> refers to <b>the structure</b> that contains data and the pointer to the next node. 
        In contrast, Node* <b>(Node pointer)</b> specifically denotes a pointer variable that stores the <b>address of the Node</b> it is pointing to.
